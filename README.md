# AB0403 – Decision Making with Programming and Analytics

This repository contains coursework and project submissions for **AB0403: Decision Making with Programming and Analytics**.  
The course focuses on using Python and data analytics to support structured decision-making, from raw data extraction to insight generation and communication.  
Through individual and group projects, analytical techniques were applied to real-world contexts such as housing preferences and industry-level AI growth trends.

## Projects Overview

### 1. HDB Sales Analysis (Individual Project – Python)

**Project Description:**  
This individual project analyses Singapore HDB resale data to understand long-term storey preferences across different flat types. Using Python, relevant transaction data was extracted and organised to compare storey popularity from 2020 to 2024, supporting data-driven insights into housing preferences.

**Research Question:**  
Which storey remains most popular among Singapore residences by flat type across the years?

**Key Applications & Outcomes:**
- Analysed multi-year HDB resale data to compare storey-level purchasing patterns by flat type
- Identified the most popular storey range for each year and the most consistently preferred storey across time
- Examined year-to-year changes to highlight rising or declining interest in specific storey ranges
- Designed an interactive program that allows users to explore results by flat model
- Translated quantitative results into clear tables and insights suitable for presentation

### 2. AI Sector Growth Analysis (Group Project – Jupyter Notebook)

**Objective:**  
To examine whether the growth of the AI sector is driven by the quantity of patents and publications, and whether these indicators show consistent patterns across industries.

**My Contribution:**  
I contributed to the **data analysis and visualization** component, focusing on the relationship between AI patents, AI publications, and sectoral growth.

**Key Applications & Outcomes:**
- Compared AI patent and publication volumes across multiple industries
- Analysed growth trends to assess whether higher quantity corresponds to stronger growth
- Evaluated consistency between patent activity and research publications
- Used bar charts to visually compare sector performance and highlight mismatches between quantity and growth
- Supported or rejected hypotheses using evidence from data rather than assumptions

**Key Insight:**  
While some sectors exhibit alignment between patent filings and publications, growth patterns vary significantly across industries, indicating that innovation dynamics differ by sector.
